      description:
        "\u26a0\ufe0f *NOTE* This digital planner is designed for use on the iPad in the app GoodNotes5 BUT you can also use this digital planner in any annotation app that allows PDF markup! (Yes also on ANDROID or MACBOOK/iMAC) Tutorial videos for iPad and Samsung Tab are included in the &#39;Start Here guide&#39; that&#39;s in your purchased files.\n\n                ** The GoodNotes app SYNCS between all apple devices that have the GoodNotes app installed. \n\n             \u26a0\ufe0fAttention!----------\u22d2 !!*Some of the apps shown in this listing are paid apps and are a SEPARATE PURCHASE from the Appstore/Playstore *!! But totally worth it, in my opinion.\n\n             \u26a0\ufe0f Please remember, a downloaded item is considered used and therefore can&#39;t be returned or refunded. Please message The Daily Planners if you need assistance with your purchase or when you have a problem. I&#39;m always happy to help or look for a solution!\n\n             \u26a0\ufe0fI recommend using the GoodNotes app and writing in this planner using an Apple Pencil or another stylus that\u2019s compatible with your device. It&#39;s also possible to just type in the document too.\n\n\ud83d\udcf9\ud83d\udca1Please read the instructions and/or watch my YouTube tutorial about the Versatile planners, I&#39;m sure your questions will be answered here:\n      !! All tutorials are made while using the GoodNotes app. \n      \u2022\u2022 Copy the link and paste into your browser \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f The flip through video is made with last year&#39;s version. Apart from some tiny improvements, this planner has the same pages!

Writing on a phone with a stylus doesn&#39;t work that well for me, but it might for you :) But please remember; the size of this planner is based on iPad screen sizes. I use the planner on my phone to check my schedule only, I do all the writing etc. on the iPad. The app GoodNotes5 is also available for MacOs. Unfortunately my planners are not optimised to use on other devices than iOs and MacOs, but you can still try it out with one of the Freebie Club planners. Create your own free account for Freebie Club on www.thedailyplanners.com to get yours.\n\n\ud83d\udca1----------\u22d2\u22d2 \u2022 \u2022 Features \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u2022 Cover\n\u2022 Help page\n\u2022 Index page for easy navigation throughout document\n\u2022 Template Library with 34+ templates \n\u2022 Custom index\n\u2022 Clickable tabs seamlessly throughout document\n\u2022 Illustrated tutorials in the planner & links to video tutorials\n\u2022 Linked Dated Pages: Dec 2022 - Dec 2023 \n  -Daily, Weekly, Monthly calendar, Month at a glance + monthly Finances & monthly custom\n\u2022 2023 overview pages\n\u2022 34+ extra templates linked inside the planner (product photo for details)\n\u2022 5 Custom tabs that can be customised with the extra templates & widgets included in this planner & Versatile Club\n\u2022 15 custom links to blank spreads (via custom index)\n\u2022 12 different paper design templates\n\u2022 Undated daily, weekly & monthly planner pages\n\u2022 Access to Versatile Club - a digital library with over 600 downloadable goodies & extra templates of all other Versatile planners\n\u2022 Matching color codes (hex)\n* Tip: duplicate pages easily for forever use!\n\nWatch the full flip through video on YouTube: The Daily Planners\nhttps://youtu.be/_UKvC9I8b8M\n\n\n----------\u2022 What files will you receive?\n   -  2 .PDF planner files: Pick wether you want the Monday start or the Sunday start version!\n   -  1 .PDF &#39;Start Here&#39; file: This text file shows the link tot the tutorial video.\n   - \ud83d\udd12Access to the-online- Versatile Club - The digital library with over 600 digital downloads.

All sales are final and cannot be returned. \nBut please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out through Etsy Messages if you have any questions. \n\n\n\u2022 Terms of Use\n\nFiles are for personal use only and may not be resold, copied, distributed, altered, shared, or used for commercial use.\n\u00a9 Tess Robin \u00ae The Daily Planners. 2021.",

        "READ BEFORE PURCHASING:\n\n** By purchasing this planner, you understand that this is a DIGITAL DOWNLOAD only. You will not receive a physical product. \n\nIt is YOUR responsibility to print this planner yourself or download to your tablet/phone.\n\nYou may use as a PDF or purchase an outside app:\n\niOS: GoodNotes 5 \nAndroid: Noteshelf **\n\n________________\n\n   ABOUT THIS PLANNER:\n\nAs a late in life ADHD diagnosed individual, I&#39;ve tried different planners and calendars and to-do lists but nothing seemed to work for me so I sat down and created my own. I made this specifically for my neurotypical brain (and now yours.) \n\nYou can choose to use all of these pages or simply choose the ones that suit your needs best (as not to overwhelm your brain because we know that happens). \n\nYou can either print this out weekly, use it on your tablet/iPad (You&#39;ll need to purchase/download these apps: GoodNotes 5 (for iOS) or Noteshelf (for Android) or you can laminate them (or buy dry erase pouches -- see links below) and use as dry erase pages.\n\nI purposely made it without any color because I found that the bright colors would distract me and it didn\u2019t feel \u201cneat\u201d enough. I also added small pictures on each page because who doesn\u2019t like to take a few moments and color sometimes. Coloring books didn\u2019t have to stop at age 8, c\u2019mon now. PLUS I created a coloring page with my art just for you! \nThere are also little doodle areas for your word vomit or your artistic masterpieces. I know I like to doodle when I am on the phone making an appointment to calm my anxiety or when I\u2019m thinking about what to write on my to-do list.\n\nI hope you love this planner and that it works for you. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to follow me on Instagram and TikTok (@ThatMomAbigail) where I talk all about being a mom who is learning to live with her ADHD.\n\n\n\n Thank you so much for your support and I really hope this helps you.\n\nRemember, you are amazing and you CAN do this!!\n\n\n\n\n***If you purchase this planner, you do not need to purchase the Cleaning Checklist listing. this planner includes all the Cleaning Checklist Pages.***\n\n________________\n\nHELPFUL TIPS:\n\nif you would like to only use a select few pages and turn them into a dry-erase board, here are some links of products that I use that you may find helpful:\n\nDry Erase Pouches: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071HWJJ64?tag=onamzabigai08-20&linkCode=ic5&ascsubtag=amzn1.infl.us.product&creativeASIN=B071HWJJ64&ref=exp_aj_kellss_dp_vv_mw \n\nDry Erase Pens: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RPXKQY7?tag=onamzabigai08-20&linkCode=ic5&ascsubtag=amzn1.infl.us.product&creativeASIN=B07RPXKQY7&ref=exp_aj_kellss_dp_vv_mw\n\n\nPlease reach out with any questions.\n \n________________\n\n\n   IMPORTANT REMINDER:\n\nPlease do not print out extra copies or share digitally with friends or family. \nPlease direct them to my Etsy shop so they can purchase their own. \n I really do want to help you out but this took a lot of time and work and each copy sold helps provide for me and my family. \n\nThank you for understanding,\n\n\n\nAbigail",

        "ADHD Planner (made by an ADHDer) - PRINTABLE Adult ADHD Journal, organizer, daily planner, self care & growth mindset pages. Science based.",
      description:
        "This printable ADHD planner is NOT just another ordinary planner with &#39;ADHD&#39; slapped on the title. It&#39;s a framework designed by an ADHD brain (mine!) especially for you and your neurodivergent brain.\n\nIt\u2019s guilt-free and it feels like a warm hug. \n\nWant to see inside the planner? \ud83d\udc40 Come check out my IG @future.adhd where I share walkthrough videos, tips and hacks, and neurospicy truth bombs. \ud83d\udca5 \n\nI thought I was terrible at planning until I realized that most planners aren&#39;t designed for my brain. They&#39;re designed for neurotypical brains. So I made this planner with one key goal in mind: MAKE A PLANNER THAT SOMEONE WITH ADHD CAN ACTUALLY STICK TO. \n\nNaturally, I did what every ADHDer does... dived down a massive rabbit hole of research! Then I got to work creating a planner based on the latest neuroscience and behavioral psychology. In every section of this adult ADHD planner, you can read the scientific reasoning, research and how our templates directly support and empower your creative, fast-brained ADHD mind.\n\nI came up with unique templates to UN-FREEZE our analysis paralysis and doom spirals, and move into healthier habits that create *real results* and help us achieve our biggest goals. \u2714\n\nThis ADHD planner is different to the other planners you&#39;ll find on the internet. It&#39;s a shame-free, customizable layout that allows you add pages each day as needed, instead of staring at a bunch of pages you haven&#39;t used and feeling guilty. It includes unique visual tools I invented based on research... like the Hyperfocus Lotus, Div/Con planning and Symmetry Stress-relief. These methods sound weird, but they actually work!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c WHAT IS THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS? \ud83d\udd2c\nThere is so much to explore when you begin researching ADHD science, but I have focused on the research that relates most pressingly to productivity and routine. The templates and the supporting information inside are based on the work of several significant contributors to ADHD research\u2026 Dr Russell Barkley, particularly his comments on the nature of attentional differentiation being linked to shifts in interest and motivation; Dr Edward Hallowell & Dr John Ratey, and particularly their work on negative self perception links to self-efficacy, and overabundance (not limitation) of attention; and Tamara Rosier and her work on divergent and convergent thinking habits in ADHD brains and &#39;light switch&#39; emotional responses to tasks which influences our executive functioning ability. The planner includes 6 pages where I cover this research and link it to areas like ADHD & time perception, Divergent & Convergent thinking, ADHD & motivation, Why ADHD Minds Wander, ADHD & exercise and ADHD Hyperfocus. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2731 What makes this planner neurodivergent-friendly? \u2731\n\nThis digital planner has many typical features, like daily planning spreads, habit trackers, meal planning and checklists, but features significant differences.\n\nOur ADHD brains start off energetically, but quickly get so overwhelmed by the sheer number of options in regular planners that we\u2019ll give up two days in. \n\nOur brains need something different, so I tested and refined these templates so you have the absolute best tools, and the highest chance of consistency.\n\nThe bottom line?

        "My stickers are all self-illustrated and are printed on a matte and self-adhesive vinyl film. From the design to the finished product, I take over all the steps myself.\n\nThe stickers are water-resistant, which means they can be washed off by hand or even get damp. They don&#39;t belong in the dishwasher! The stickers are not scratch-resistant, so caution is advised.\n\nThe colors may differ from the colors displayed on the screen. Excellent bonding on all smooth/non-porous surfaces and can be easily removed from non-porous, smooth surfaces without leaving any residue\n\nThe stickers are printed to order, so personal wishes are easy to implement, just write me an e-mail in advance.

      description:
        "This &quot;Overstimulated&quot; repeated word t-shirt appears in the colors of the ADHD flag - ADHD is *so much more* than the &quot;Oh look a squirrel!&quot; stereotypes that are often demeaning and don&#39;t capture what being neurodivergent can feel like, and our clothes at NoThoughtsJustVibes seek to represent the neurodivergent community in a way that&#39;s both positive and conversation provoking.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nThis Bella and Canvas 3001 brand short sleeved unisex / gender-neutral jersey t-shirt is sized for adults. These t-shirts have ribbed knit collars to improve shaping, and the shoulders have taping for better fit over time. Dual side seams hold the garment&#39;s shape for longer. This shirt is made of light fabric (100% Airlume combed and ringspun Cotton), runs true to size, is a retail fit, and has a tear away label. Any props or additional clothing used in the photos are unfortunately not included in your purchase. \n\nHere at NoThoughtsJustVibes we do not discriminate based on size - that means regardless of if you&#39;re purchasing a size S or a size 3XL, your price will be the same. We are currently trying to find a print provider with more inclusive sizing, so if the size you are looking for currently falls outside the S-3XL range please be patient with us! \n\nPlease wash this garment in cold water on gentle cycle, and be sure to turn it inside out to keep the design lasting brighter for longer. \n\nYou can tumble dry the shirt on low or let it air dry. It\u2019s not going to catch on fire or anything crazy if you don\u2019t follow these directions, but please note your design is likely to fade more quickly if you don\u2019t! \n\nIt is also not recommended that you use Bleach or Fabric Softener on this item. Please also avoid directly ironing on top of the design.\n\nThis item is made to order - Be sure to check the sizing chart before purchasing. If you are looking for a tighter fit, we recommend sizing down as these items are unisex and are made to be a little more loose. \n\nIf for some reason you receive your item and it is damaged, please contact us right away. We do accept returns for damage that occurs during processing or shipping as well as exchanges if your sizing is wrong. We ask that you contact us within 30 days of delivery to kickstart this process.",

        "An explanation of ADHD symptoms and regulation strategies in kids terms.\n\nA story for understanding a neurodivergent brain created and inspired by my daughters ADHD diagnosis, I wanted to gift her a book that help explained her brain&#39;s processes and needs. \nNO big words OR acronyms that result in &#39;what does that mean&#39; and bring the child out of the story. \n\n&quot;Brains are just like cars, they all drive round and round a track, picking up information and then bringing it back. Some brains are Race Cars that like to drive extra fast. Sometimes though, they forget to sop and fully complete a task.&#39; \n\nBut driving cars fast all the time and not servicing or maintaining them leads to overheating and burnout. \nWe can apply that same logic to our brains.",

      description:
        "\u2728 DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL DAILY PLANNER. \u2728\n\nReimagine your life with the Hyperfocus Day Planner: a daily agenda that ditches the traditional hourly schedule for a &quot;block-scheduling&quot; system\u2014a science-based framework that reduces overwhelm and supercharges productivity in ADHD, Autistic and Neurodivergent people\u2014helping them excel in all areas of their life.\n\n\u2022 SO WHY BLOCK SCHEDULING?\n\nNeurodivergent people aren\u2019t great at executive function. So when ADHD + Autistic brains are presented with an hourly agenda, we just overbook ourselves into failure.\n\nHourly planners also don&#39;t account for time going astray: your mom calls, your dog needs to go outside again, something took longer than it should. Often times, this makes us feel like a failure, because we can never seem to stay on schedule (and often overestimate what we can get done!). \n\n\u2022 BLOCK SCHEDULING ON THE OTHER HAND...\n\nAllows you to play to your Neurodivergent strengths:  use block-scheduling to focus more intensely on your tasks, with the confidence of knowing that everything you want or need to do, will get done, because you have a \u201cblock\u201d for it. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nYup, that\u2019s right.\n\u2570 Imagine having an increased awareness of time.\n\u2570 Imagine hyperfocusing in peace (but in a way that\u2019s strategic and structured for success!)\n\u2570 Imagine batching your day into themed sections\u2014and assigning tasks into manageable chunks accordingly. \n\u2570 Imagine the hard / boring tasks being a lot less intimidating.\n\u2570Imagine having a system built for YOU, so you\u2019re not constantly throttling between \u201cI\u2019m on fire\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m burned out.\u201d\n\u2570Imagine thriving at multiple areas of your life (and not just one!)\n\nAll of this in the Hyperfocus Day Planner\u2026and that\u2019s not just it!\n\nThis day planner was thoughtfully designed by an AuDHD brain to be:\n\ud83d\ude00 Simple\n\ud83d\ude00 Very simple\n\ud83d\ude00 Did I say simple?\n\nThis is because a daily planner\u2019s job is to do one thing: actually improve your life.",

      description:
        "Neurodivergent Affirmation Stickers! THE ORIGINAL! \nDon&#39;t fall for the copies! Get the original neurodivergent affirmation back from the original artist \u2665\n\nBeing neurodivergent often comes with a lot of overthinking due to past experiences or anxiety around misunderstanding social cues. (neurotypicals are confusing!) Remind yourself that being yourself is not wrong! \n\nPerfect for sticking in your journal or stick on something you use regularly, like a waterbottle, to constantly remind yourself that being you is the best!\n\n8 Pack - Beautiful, vivid, handmade stickers in a compostable, ecofriendly &quot;cellophane&quot; bag with a handmade label!\n\nEach sticker is between 6cm-7cm long and 2cm-3cm high. \n\nThese stickers are super adhesive so you won&#39;t have to worry about them peeling off. For this reason I don&#39;t recommend replacing your sticker once it&#39;s stuck if you&#39;d like to use it again. A small amount of residue may be left when unpeeling but this is easily removed. \n\nStickers are waterproof! While the design itself will not smudge, even in water, I recommend only lightly hand washing any item you&#39;re placing your sticker on, eg waterbottles, if you want your sticker to last. \n\nPlease be aware - as my stickers are handmade they are posted from home. If you order additional items, eg hoodie, you will receive your stickers separately. \n\nShipping is free for those in the UK and super cheap for everyone else!\n\nStickers will be sent in a secure envelope but will not be tracked. Tracked shipping can be arranged but you will be charged for this. \n\nPhotos represent the stickers accurately at the time they are taken, however there may be small changes to colour, size or style when they arrive. This is because I am always making sure you get the best quality possible so small tweaks may be made.\n\nIf you love these designs, take a look at the rest of my shop! I make designs for people like me, who have chronic illnesses and disabilities. Thanks so much for supporting a small, disabled creator \u2665\n\nTHE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FOR THIS STICKER PACK IS OWNED BY ME AND COPIES WILL BE REPORTED! :)",

        "\u2731 MONOCHROME/BLACK & WHITE PLANNER \u2731\n\nThis printable ADHD planner is NOT just another ordinary planner with &#39;ADHD&#39; slapped on the title. It&#39;s a framework designed by an ADHD brain (mine!) especially for you and your neurodivergent brain.\n\nIt\u2019s guilt-free and it feels like a warm hug. \n\nWant to see inside the planner? \ud83d\udc40 Come check out my IG @future.adhd where I share walkthrough videos, tips and hacks, and neurospicy truth bombs. \ud83d\udca5 \n\nI thought I was terrible at planning until I realized that most planners aren&#39;t designed for my brain. They&#39;re designed for neurotypical brains. So I made this planner with one key goal in mind: MAKE A PLANNER THAT SOMEONE WITH ADHD CAN ACTUALLY STICK TO. \n\nNaturally, I did what every ADHDer does... dived down a massive rabbit hole of research! Then I got to work creating a planner based on the latest neuroscience and behavioral psychology. In every section of this adult ADHD planner, you can read the scientific reasoning, research and how our templates directly support and empower your creative, fast-brained ADHD mind.\n\nI came up with unique templates to UN-FREEZE our analysis paralysis and doom spirals, and move into healthier habits that create *real results* and help us achieve our biggest goals. \u2714\n\nThis ADHD planner is different to the other planners you&#39;ll find on the internet. It&#39;s a shame-free, customizable layout that allows you add pages each day as needed, instead of staring at a bunch of pages you haven&#39;t used and feeling guilty. It includes unique visual tools I invented based on research... like the Hyperfocus Lotus, Div/Con planning and Symmetry Stress-relief. These methods sound weird, but they actually work!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c WHAT IS THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS? \ud83d\udd2c\nThere is so much to explore when you begin researching ADHD science, but I have focused on the research that relates most pressingly to productivity and routine. The templates and the supporting information inside are based on the work of several significant contributors to ADHD research\u2026 Dr Russell Barkley, particularly his comments on the nature of attentional differentiation being linked to shifts in interest and motivation; Dr Edward Hallowell & Dr John Ratey, and particularly their work on negative self perception links to self-efficacy, and overabundance (not limitation) of attention; and Tamara Rosier and her work on divergent and convergent thinking habits in ADHD brains and &#39;light switch&#39; emotional responses to tasks which influences our executive functioning ability. \nThe planner includes 6 pages where I cover this research and link it to areas like ADHD & time perception, Divergent & Convergent thinking, ADHD & motivation, Why ADHD Minds Wander, ADHD & exercise and ADHD Hyperfocus. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2731 What makes this planner neurodivergent-friendly? \u2731\n\nThis planner has many typical features, like daily planning spreads, habit trackers, meal planning and checklists, but features significant differences.\n\nOur ADHD brains start off energetically, but quickly get so overwhelmed by the sheer number of options in regular planners that we\u2019ll give up two days in. \n\nOur brains need something different, so I tested and refined these templates so you have the absolute best tools, and the highest chance of consistency.\n\nThe bottom line? Every single page and template inside this planner has been carefully and intentionally created to scaffold, support and guide you to a place of more mental clarity, and less chaos and white noise.\n\nSound amazing? It is. Get the ultimate tool to help you succeed!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nOTHER PRINTABLE PLANNERS IN COLOUR:\n\ud83c\udf1e PINK/GOLD - Printable ADHD Planner \u2192 https://etsy.me/3nEvf4R\n\ud83c\udf08 RAINBOW - Printable ADHD Planner \u2192 https://etsy.me/3IbnQnf\n\nMY DIGITAL (iPad/tablet/phone) PLANNERS:\n\ud83c\udf1e PINK/GOLD - Digital/iPad ADHD Planner \u2192 https://etsy.me/3b1E9a0\n\ud83c\udf08 RAINBOW - Digital/iPad ADHD Planner \u2192 https://etsy.me/3JHQFIB\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u2731\u2731 INCLUDED IN THIS 170-PAGE PLANNER \u2731\u2731\n\nBlack & White for low-cost printing and users who prefer monochrome (and to add their own colour).\n\nSizing:\n- US Letter\n- A4 / A5\n- Happy Planner\n\n\u2302 QUICK START GUIDE (to get you on your way without overwhelm)\n\n\ud81a\udd10 COVERS \ud81a\udd10 \n\n\u2302  14 cover options (pick your fave or rotate for novelty)\n\n\n\n\ud81a\udd10 Calendars \ud81a\udd10\n\n\u2302 2023 dated planners (Sun or Mon start)\n\u2302 Undated calendar\n\u2302 Lifetime access to all future annual editions of the planner\n\n\n\ud81a\udd10 Organizing, prioritizing and productivity \ud81a\udd10 \n\n\u2302 Daily planner (in multiple layouts, ADHD specific)\n\u2302 Weekly planner (undated)\n\u2302 Monthly planner & Jan-Dec calendar (undated)\n\u2302 &#39;Do it with dopamine&#39; (multiple formats - reward-based templates for completing boring tasks)\n\u2302 Get sh*t done to do list with reward sections (weekdays & weekends)\n\u2302 Div/Con planning - to help you move from brainstorm ideation to logical action\n\u2302 Real-world priorities template (based on the Eisenhower Matrix)\n\n\n\ud81a\udd10 Remember Stuff - tracking tools \ud81a\udd10\n\n\u2302 New friend names - tracker (so you never awkwardly forget someone\u2019s name again)\n\u2302 D&Ms with friends - tracker\n\u2302 #ADHDtax (yes it&#39;s a thing) - tracker\n\u2302 Hyper-focus list to store all the information you deep-dive into\n\u2302 Parcel arrival - tracker (so you don\u2019t forget those 5 widgets you ordered \ud83d\udce6)\n\u2302 24 hr cart list (designed to reduce impulsive online shopping \ud83d\uded2)\n\u2302 Podcasts I need to finish - tracker \n\u2302 Books I started - tracker\n\u2302 Assignment due date - tracker \n\u2302 Passwords - tracker \n\n\n\ud81a\udd10 Healthy Habit Setting \ud81a\udd10 \n\nI get it.

      description:
        "\ud83c\udf08 RAINBOW *PRINTABLE* ADHD PLANNER \ud83c\udf08\n\nThis printable ADHD planner is NOT just another ordinary planner with &#39;ADHD&#39; slapped on the title. It&#39;s a framework designed by an ADHD brain (mine!) especially for you and your neurodivergent brain.\n\nIt\u2019s guilt-free and it feels like a warm hug. \n\nWant to see inside the planner? \ud83d\udc40 Come check out my IG @future.adhd where I share walkthrough videos, tips and hacks, and neurospicy truth bombs. \ud83d\udca5 \n\nI thought I was terrible at planning until I realized that most planners aren\u2019t designed for my brain. They\u2019re designed for neurotypical brains. So I made this planner with one key goal in mind: MAKE A PLANNER THAT SOMEONE WITH ADHD CAN ACTUALLY STICK TO. \n\nNaturally, I did what every ADHDer does... dived down a massive rabbit hole of research! Then I got to work creating a planner based on the latest neuroscience and behavioral psychology. In every section of this adult ADHD planner, you can read the scientific reasoning, research and how our templates directly support and empower your creative, fast-brained ADHD mind.\n\nI came up with unique templates to UN-FREEZE our analysis paralysis and doom spirals, and move into healthier habits that create *real results* and help us achieve our biggest goals. \u2714\n\nThis ADHD planner is different to the other planners you\u2019ll find on the internet. It&#39;s a shame-free, customizable layout that allows you add pages each day as needed, instead of staring at a bunch of pages you haven&#39;t used and feeling guilty. It includes unique visual tools I invented based on research... like the Hyperfocus Lotus, Div/Con planning and Symmetry Stress-relief. These methods sound weird, but they actually work!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\ud83d\udd2c WHAT IS THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS? \ud83d\udd2c\nThere is so much to explore when you begin researching ADHD science, but I have focused on the research that relates most pressingly to productivity and routine. The templates and the supporting information inside are based on the work of several significant contributors to ADHD research\u2026 Dr Russell Barkley, particularly his comments on the nature of attentional differentiation being linked to shifts in interest and motivation; Dr Edward Hallowell & Dr John Ratey, and particularly their work on negative self perception links to self-efficacy, and overabundance (not limitation) of attention; and Tamara Rosier and her work on divergent and convergent thinking habits in ADHD brains and &#39;light switch&#39; emotional responses to tasks which influences our executive functioning ability. \nThe planner includes 6 pages where I cover this research and link it to areas like ADHD & time perception, Divergent & Convergent thinking, ADHD & motivation, Why ADHD Minds Wander, ADHD & exercise and ADHD Hyperfocus. \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u2731 What makes this planner neurodivergent-friendly? \u2731\n\nThis printable planner has many typical features, like daily planning spreads, habit trackers, meal planning and checklists, but features significant differences.\n\nOur ADHD brains start off energetically, but quickly get so overwhelmed by the sheer number of options we\u2019ll give up two days in. \n\nOur brains need something different, so I tested and refined these templates so you have the absolute best tools, and the highest chance of consistency.\n\nThe bottom line? Every single page and template inside this planner is carefully and intentionally created to scaffold, support and guide you to a place of more mental clarity, and less chaos and white noise.\n\nSound amazing? It is.
